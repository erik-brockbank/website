      <p>
        Broadly, I'm interested in a diverse set of questions about how children and adults learn and
        reason about the world around them. My work uses behavioral experiments and computational modeling
        techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to explore these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My doctoral research is focused on how people come to understand rich patterns in other
        people's behavior and develop abstractions that generalize to new settings.
      </p>
        <p>
          Below is an overview of my work organized loosely by topic,
          with links to papers, talks, and other fun stuff.

        <p>
          Adults have an amazing ability to reason about abstract number in all kinds of ways.
          But this doesn't come for free; kids struggle to learn basic concepts of number long after
          they've learned how to count.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What's the basis for adult number reasoning and how do kids learn it?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Work I've done looking at numerical reasoning has used computational modeling techniques
          to try and formalize, a) the strategies children use when reasoning about number and,
          b) the process by which adults estimate number in the world around them.

      <div class="topic-overview">
        <p>
          In many learning environments, the process of <b>explaining</b> new data can lead
          adults and children to favor more abstract, generalizable solutions.
          This has obvious educational import, but also raises interesting psychological questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>How does explanation lead to greater abstraction when learning?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          My work in this space has looked at the impact of explanation on <em>relational reasoning</em>
          in kids, and tried to nail down whether explanation helps adults <em>generate</em> certain
          hypotheses, or makes them <em>evaluate</em> existing hypotheses differently.
